We came for the land’s first Art of Hosting and Harvesting Conversations that Matter training. Though we hailed from different countries and walks of life, we were all drawn by a single question:</p><blockquote><p>“How can we reconnect to our shared humanity - so that we can weave a thriving future for all?”</p></blockquote><p>Over the next four days, we laughed, we cried; we held space for each other's grief, and the hope that followed. We had the conversations that really matter to us. And above all, we experienced the magic — the sacredness — that emerges when people show up for each other  with love, respect, and honesty.</p><p>This post is a harvest of our time together.</p><p>To our old friends: May this serve as a reminder of our shared learning.</p><p>To those discovering us for the first time: We hope this glimpse inspires you to join us next time.</p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mAb3kxSEZi4?si=ff73YzMuDZiXL2lI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><h3><strong>Story of Day 1</strong></h3><p>I crossed town from Wan Chai to Sha Tin with a blend of excitement and anxiety. I wasn’t sure what this ‘Art of Hosting’ thing was really about, but I know I could trust my friend’s recommendation.</p><p>We had a big opening circle, populated by even bigger hearts. A sharing of stories, intentions, and presence. A buzz in the air of anticipation, wonder, and purpose. Who are these people? What stories do they hold, what gifts do they carry? All having heard the call of a thriving shared humanity. We cared for each other as we witnessed, offered presence, and shared warmth through our gaze. We connected over nibbles of snacks and chit chat, before finding the depth and purpose of our time together.</p><p>The 4-fold practice reminded me why I belonged here. Where am I on the 4-fold path? What was easy? What was still out of reach? What inspired me? Hosting myself better definitely was a key next step for all aspects of my life. The very beginning of the journey, yet, I never was aware of its importance. Never thought I deserve the time to host myself so that I can host others and the community better.</p><p>Among the 4-fold path, we stood at the points where we were good at and wrote down our good practice. Then we were encouraged to “steal” those practices from the others. It was a great reminder that we could learn a lot from the community, and there were always people who excel at that which we were not good at. It made growth easier because of the diversity we had as a community.</p><p>The first day ended. Even though I had just met my roommates a few hours ago, I saw them vividly in my dream. What kind of connection could we have in the coming days?</p><h3><strong>Story of Day 2</strong></h3><p>Awakening in a new bed, a new space, and on new ground. The sky was clear, the air chilly, and curiosity was fully alive. Messages arrived as the sun rose, sparking FOMO in me. I let it go  with a meeting of movement. Tai chi with Brent, nature walking with William. Joyful breath and grateful grounding as the day began.</p><p>The morning canteen was buzzing. There were yummy eggs and people performed the simple act of service by clearing plates and tables. Tick-tock, the opening circle was calling and the day began.</p><p>Learning the Chaordic Path and discovering the world was moving toward Chamos was like a slap to the face. And here we were, wannabe care-takers, having to prepare to work within it. But we didn’t stay there for long. We entered the “World Cafe” to unpack the calling question of our training. We sat in small groups and shared stories around a set of questions designed by the team who hosted this methodology.</p><p>“When have I been touched by someone’s humanity (including my own)?” “When have I felt disconnected?” “How could we weave connections in service of a thriving future?” I heard beautiful tales. Maggie hosted children from Africa to live in her house; Billy shared the story of a lady in his city who shared accessible rooms for travellers with disabilities; Stephanie shared a “birds in cage” moment in Hong Kong. I shared a story about university students creating resting spaces for cleaning staff whose needs were often ignored. By sharing these glimpses of humanity, we were truly touched by each other. Everyone here was talking about humanity and connection, both inside and outside the room—that was the future we were working hard to realise.</p><p>Learning about the 4 Levels of Listening clarified so much of what was often missing in important relationships. I knew I had to embody this and brought it back home, gently framing moments to enable the deeper listening I crave. This idea of communication depth appeared again in the Wicked Question game. The question I formulated for myself truly "made me tremble," touching deep into my communication patterns: what gets in the way, and what do I ultimately want to happen? This question had been blooming in me for too long. Now was the time to act, nurture, heal, and love that part of myself.</p><h3><strong>Story of Day 3</strong></h3><p>I never imagined a process could be so powerful.</p><p>Each of us in the circle were asked to write down the answers to a profound question: “ Standing at the crossroads, what do I need to put down or let go? What do I need to pick up? What do I need to be open to?</p><p>At first, I felt a bit lost. Did I have something to put down? What if I didn’t? I paused for a moment. I didn’t write down anything, leaving the paper empty. Then I saw the tears. I witnessed my fellows’ pains, hopes, struggles…I felt fully connected. I cried for the humanity in that space, Not for the pain nor the fear, but for our deep connection that was emerging then. I filled my paper, lined up and put it into the bowl.</p><p>Actually, two papers. Two processes. One to make space, another one to fill it with what I had been longing for—the person I wanted to become. In sequence. Letting go, then invoking, committing. Changing my story, committing to materialise it. That ceremony was so powerful, I couldn’t stop my tears. It was hard to move onto the next section, where I needed to tell my story. I couldn’t find focus, until I looked into the eyes of my witness and harvesters, who were eager to hear my story. I was ready. Now!</p><p>For celebration! After the intensity and softness of that crossroads, we found our way to high ground. We ate, laughed, and swayed with the music, the wind, and each other. The joyful chaos of veggie dogs, grilled pineapples, and sneaky chicken wings. Children, big and small, found a shared inner space. The passion for the land shone through with full bellies and warm hearts. These sparks of shared humanity filled me with hope for what comes next, for each of us, and for all of us.</p><h3><strong>Story of Day 4</strong></h3><p>It was an incredible moment when Mary Alice walked us through the 8 Breaths of Design. It illuminated the entire journey of hosting, highlighting crucial parts I often unconsciously ignore. For example, while I have a strong calling to host workshops for factory workers, I haven't sufficiently clarified how that calling relates to them. I often forget to properly harvest and reflect on the journey with them.</p><p>This pattern radiated power. It covered everything and could be applied everywhere, from hosting mundane conversations to bringing large scale projects to fruition. This was the map that I needed to walk comfortably into the unknown.</p><p>I was lucky that I also signed up for Design from Harvest without fully understanding it. That collaborative reflection helped me clarify how to execute my next key step and turning point, well and in detail, drawing from the multiple perspectives and experiences around the table. It’s magical what we can achieve when we collaborate thoughtfully and with intent.</p><p>As it was the last day, there was no briefing. Maybe a more relaxed lunch? Haha. Then came the debriefing. Not a second wasted in AoH! As the hosts of the Open Space Technology on the previous days, we reflected on what we did well, and what could be improved. Amazing feedback from both the coaches and participants' hosts.</p><p>Back in the circle, it was time to harvest. What have we received in these 4 days of being together? We laughed, we cried cried cried, we hugged, we danced. We learned so many powerful pattern and methods. We witnessed so much potential and possibility. Now let’s take it slow, digesting bit by bit. How can this experience be useful for my future efforts and our future evolution? Recognising the importance of team, support, and the movement towards mastery. Trembling when recognising what seems tough or harder to reach, excited for what to come. Feeling hopeful knowing paths ahead will be walked with others.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 20, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://aoh-hk.github.io/pb-pages/art-of-hosting-training-breakthrough-village/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Invitation: Art of Hosting Training @ Breakthrough Youth Village (November 21-24, 2025)</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii.</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://aoh-hk.github.io/pb-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://aoh-hk.github.io/pb-pages/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=d0fc1030089a37f93a2d51bf6d07565c"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
