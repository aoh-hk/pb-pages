            "content_html": "<p>On November 21st, 2025, more than 40 people gathered at Breakthrough Youth Village in Sha Tin, Hong Kong. We came for the land’s first Art of Hosting and Harvesting Conversations that Matter training. Though we hailed from different countries and walks of life, we were all drawn by a single question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“How can we reconnect to our shared humanity - so that we can weave a thriving future for all?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the next four days, we laughed, we cried; we held space for each other's grief, and the hope that followed. We had the conversations that really matter to us. And above all, we experienced the magic — the sacredness — that emerges when people show up for each other  with love, respect, and honesty.</p>\n<p>This post is a harvest of our time together.</p>\n<p>To our old friends: May this serve as a reminder of our shared learning.</p>\n<p>To those discovering us for the first time: We hope this glimpse inspires you to join us next time.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mAb3kxSEZi4?si=ff73YzMuDZiXL2lI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<h3><strong>Story of Day 1</strong></h3>\n<p>I crossed town from Wan Chai to Sha Tin with a blend of excitement and anxiety. I wasn’t sure what this ‘Art of Hosting’ thing was really about, but I know I could trust my friend’s recommendation.</p>\n<p>We had a big opening circle, populated by even bigger hearts. A sharing of stories, intentions, and presence. A buzz in the air of anticipation, wonder, and purpose. Who are these people? What stories do they hold, what gifts do they carry? All having heard the call of a thriving shared humanity. We cared for each other as we witnessed, offered presence, and shared warmth through our gaze. We connected over nibbles of snacks and chit chat, before finding the depth and purpose of our time together.</p>\n<p>The 4-fold practice reminded me why I belonged here. Where am I on the 4-fold path? What was easy? What was still out of reach? What inspired me? Hosting myself better definitely was a key next step for all aspects of my life. The very beginning of the journey, yet, I never was aware of its importance. Never thought I deserve the time to host myself so that I can host others and the community better.</p>\n<p>Among the 4-fold path, we stood at the points where we were good at and wrote down our good practice. Then we were encouraged to “steal” those practices from the others. It was a great reminder that we could learn a lot from the community, and there were always people who excel at that which we were not good at. It made growth easier because of the diversity we had as a community.</p>\n<p>The first day ended. Even though I had just met my roommates a few hours ago, I saw them vividly in my dream. What kind of connection could we have in the coming days?</p>\n<h3><strong>Story of Day 2</strong></h3>\n<p>Awakening in a new bed, a new space, and on new ground. The sky was clear, the air chilly, and curiosity was fully alive. Messages arrived as the sun rose, sparking FOMO in me. I let it go  with a meeting of movement. Tai chi with Brent, nature walking with William. Joyful breath and grateful grounding as the day began.</p>\n<p>The morning canteen was buzzing. There were yummy eggs and people performed the simple act of service by clearing plates and tables. Tick-tock, the opening circle was calling and the day began.</p>\n<p>Learning the Chaordic Path and discovering the world was moving toward Chamos was like a slap to the face. And here we were, wannabe care-takers, having to prepare to work within it. But we didn’t stay there for long. We entered the “World Cafe” to unpack the calling question of our training. We sat in small groups and shared stories around a set of questions designed by the team who hosted this methodology.</p>\n<p>“When have I been touched by someone’s humanity (including my own)?” “When have I felt disconnected?” “How could we weave connections in service of a thriving future?” I heard beautiful tales. Maggie hosted children from Africa to live in her house; Billy shared the story of a lady in his city who shared accessible rooms for travellers with disabilities; Stephanie shared a “birds in cage” moment in Hong Kong. I shared a story about university students creating resting spaces for cleaning staff whose needs were often ignored. By sharing these glimpses of humanity, we were truly touched by each other. Everyone here was talking about humanity and connection, both inside and outside the room—that was the future we were working hard to realise.</p>\n<p>Learning about the 4 Levels of Listening clarified so much of what was often missing in important relationships. I knew I had to embody this and brought it back home, gently framing moments to enable the deeper listening I crave. This idea of communication depth appeared again in the Wicked Question game. The question I formulated for myself truly \"made me tremble,\" touching deep into my communication patterns: what gets in the way, and what do I ultimately want to happen? This question had been blooming in me for too long. Now was the time to act, nurture, heal, and love that part of myself.</p>\n<h3><strong>Story of Day 3</strong></h3>\n<p>I never imagined a process could be so powerful.</p>\n<p>Each of us in the circle were asked to write down the answers to a profound question: “ Standing at the crossroads, what do I need to put down or let go? What do I need to pick up? What do I need to be open to?</p>\n<p>At first, I felt a bit lost. Did I have something to put down? What if I didn’t? I paused for a moment. I didn’t write down anything, leaving the paper empty. Then I saw the tears. I witnessed my fellows’ pains, hopes, struggles…I felt fully connected. I cried for the humanity in that space, Not for the pain nor the fear, but for our deep connection that was emerging then. I filled my paper, lined up and put it into the bowl.</p>\n<p>Actually, two papers. Two processes. One to make space, another one to fill it with what I had been longing for—the person I wanted to become. In sequence. Letting go, then invoking, committing. Changing my story, committing to materialise it. That ceremony was so powerful, I couldn’t stop my tears. It was hard to move onto the next section, where I needed to tell my story. I couldn’t find focus, until I looked into the eyes of my witness and harvesters, who were eager to hear my story. I was ready. Now!</p>\n<p>For celebration! After the intensity and softness of that crossroads, we found our way to high ground. We ate, laughed, and swayed with the music, the wind, and each other. The joyful chaos of veggie dogs, grilled pineapples, and sneaky chicken wings. Children, big and small, found a shared inner space. The passion for the land shone through with full bellies and warm hearts. These sparks of shared humanity filled me with hope for what comes next, for each of us, and for all of us.</p>\n<h3><strong>Story of Day 4</strong></h3>\n<p>It was an incredible moment when Mary Alice walked us through the 8 Breaths of Design. It illuminated the entire journey of hosting, highlighting crucial parts I often unconsciously ignore. For example, while I have a strong calling to host workshops for factory workers, I haven't sufficiently clarified how that calling relates to them. I often forget to properly harvest and reflect on the journey with them.</p>\n<p>This pattern radiated power. It covered everything and could be applied everywhere, from hosting mundane conversations to bringing large scale projects to fruition. This was the map that I needed to walk comfortably into the unknown.</p>\n<p>I was lucky that I also signed up for Design from Harvest without fully understanding it. That collaborative reflection helped me clarify how to execute my next key step and turning point, well and in detail, drawing from the multiple perspectives and experiences around the table. It’s magical what we can achieve when we collaborate thoughtfully and with intent.</p>\n<p>As it was the last day, there was no briefing. Maybe a more relaxed lunch? Haha. Then came the debriefing. Not a second wasted in AoH! As the hosts of the Open Space Technology on the previous days, we reflected on what we did well, and what could be improved. Amazing feedback from both the coaches and participants' hosts.</p>\n<p>Back in the circle, it was time to harvest. What have we received in these 4 days of being together? We laughed, we cried cried cried, we hugged, we danced. We learned so many powerful pattern and methods. We witnessed so much potential and possibility. Now let’s take it slow, digesting bit by bit. How can this experience be useful for my future efforts and our future evolution? Recognising the importance of team, support, and the movement towards mastery. Trembling when recognising what seems tough or harder to reach, excited for what to come. Feeling hopeful knowing paths ahead will be walked with others.</p>",

Suddenly, it can seem that the familiar has vanished, leaving the future shrouded in uncertainty. We feel that we are standing on fractured ground, gazing at a horizon we struggle to define. We may feel that we don’t even know ourselves anymore.</p>\n<p>Yet beneath the turbulence, an unshaken truth endures—a quiet, stubborn love for the places we call home. Though the path ahead remains uncharted, our roots hold firm, even when overshadowed by the noise of conflict.</p>\n<p>So we ask: Can we mend our fragmented world and co-create a future that honors our shared humanity, embraces complexity, and reclaims neglected interdependence? How do we stand in these broken places, listen across divides, and plant seeds of intention for a collective tomorrow?</p>\n<p>Perhaps now is the time to return to essentials — to truly listen and support each other and to find generative ways to work and co-create together.</p>\n<p>This is where The Art of Hosting and Harvesting Conversations That Matter becomes vital.</p>\n<p>Join us on our 4-day transformative journey designed to equip you with the tools to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Host dialogues that bridge divides</li>\n<li>Navigate diversity with curiosity</li>\n<li>Cultivate shared understanding</li>\n<li>Harness our collective wisdom to shape tomorrow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, we’ll learn, grow, and put these practices into action-building foundations for a future woven from courage, connection, and hope.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/74325910?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc&dnt=1\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h3 class=\"align-left\">A Global Community</h3>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Art of Hosting (AoH) has been developed and formed into a coherent whole over 20 years by a global community of practitioners dedicated to making the world a better place. It has been applied in a wide range of environments – from corporate and institutions in private and public sectors, to communities and families.</p>\n<p>Organisations using AoH as a working practice report better collaboration and decision-making, more innovation, greater ability to quickly respond to opportunity, challenge and change, and improved relationships. People who experience AoH typically say that they walk away feeling more inspired and empowered, and more able to guide the meetings and conversations they are part of to move towards desirable outcomes.</p>\n<p>If you would like to know more, please visit <a href=\"www.artofhosting.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.artofhosting.org</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"align-left\">What is Art of Hosting?</h3>\n<p>Art of Hosting (AoH) is a highly effective suite of powerful conversational processes and practices to harness the collective intelligence of groups, to foster effective multi-stakeholder collaboration and create robust, sustainable solutions. The name reflects that the heart of our practices are conversations that make a difference. The art is in holding them in a way that empowers people to step in and take accountability. It fosters dynamic open spaces where deep listening, connection, and growth flourishes.</p>\n<p>We will spend our time engaging in profound conversations about what matters to us, centered around our core calling question, where you will be able to practice deep listening, asking powerful questions, and using a suite of participatory techniques guided by an international team of experienced practitioners.</p>\n<p>AoH also places emphasis on 'harvesting' — the process of distilling insights and seeds of action from conversations, rather than simply recording results. Good harvesting leads to new understandings, actionable proposals, and deeper trust and connection, serving as the nourishment for ongoing transformation.</p>\n<p>The training is fully participatory — you will have the opportunity to immediately apply what you learn into practice, and to learn through practice. Rooted in AoH’s fundamental patterns, we will explore methods, frameworks and theories that support meaningful conversations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Circle Way</li>\n<li>World Café</li>\n<li>Open Space Technology</li>\n<li>Appreciative Enquiry</li>\n<li>Storytelling</li>\n<li>The Chaordic Path</li>\n<li>Designing for Wiser Action</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of all, it will be fun! You will bond with, exchange interesting stories and insights from people of different backgrounds and cultures, learn from each others’ experiences, and discover a sense of community that often continues well beyond the training itself. You will come away from the training feeling refreshed and empowered, and perhaps with a seed of change planted that you may not even realise!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The world we have made, as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far, creates problems we cannot solve at the same level of thinking at which we created them.” - Albert Einstein</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"align-left\">Who is this training for?</h3>\n<p>If you are a business or team leader, a facilitator or group process consultant, a community supporter or just someone interested in creating better meetings, this immersive and practical training is for you.</p>\n<p>It will be a fantastic opportunity to learn and connect with others who are exploring the power of collaboration, leading systemic change and innovation in China, Asia and worldwide.</p>\n<p><strong>Join us if you are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ready to step into the challenging conversations that can lead to innovation</li>\n<li>Wondering how to make inclusive decisions in an efficient way</li>\n<li>Eager to create a more horizontal work culture in your organisation</li>\n<li>Passionate to bring new life to a project or initiative through collaboration</li>\n<li>Already hosting networks or systemic change initiatives, and curious about how to deepen them, scale them up or make them more sustainable</li>\n<li>Inspired to make a positive impact on those around you</li>\n<li>Curious and open to explore new ways of being and doing</li>\n<li>Exploring dialogue-based facilitation as a life path and career choice</li>\n<li>Ready to turn a new life chapter, and seeking for inspiration and support from a diverse community of practitioners</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>We welcome you with open hearts!</em></p>\n<h3>What will you learn and experience?</h3>\n<div class=\"framer-1qroh3v\" data-framer-component-type=\"RichTextContainer\">\n<p class=\"framer-text\"><strong>By joining this training, you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn how to design, host and harvest an engaging event – meetings, workshops, conferences, lectures</li>\n<li>Gain new models that help make sense of complexity and improve decision making at work</li>\n<li>Learn how to design and use powerful questions to enable more reflection and innovation</li>\n<li>Experience a style of leadership that fosters psychological safety, opening up the possibility of making your personal and professional lives much more integrated and enjoyable</li>\n<li>Get an experience and basic understanding of powerful collaborative methodologies that can be put to practice in groups of any size</li>\n<li>Make new friends and connect to a thriving global network of practitioners</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/143626237?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc&dnt=1\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h3>Participation Fee &amp; Registration</h3>\n<p>To allow this training to be as inclusive as possible, while balancing the need to enable the training to happen and support a fair and healthy economy, we are offering a 3-tiered fee structure as follows.

I enjoy collaborating with different teams, using participatory approaches to reflect, connect, and learn together. My work often engages with global citizenship education, drama education, and participatory evaluation. I love being a collaborator—exploring through dialogue how communities and societies can become more caring, just, and sustainable.</p>\n<p>After twenty years in this field, I’ve come to realise that meaningful change begins with learning how to connect with ourselves before we can truly connect with others and with our communities. This is never easy. In the busy nonprofit world, we often strive for change but sometimes push in the wrong way. Attending the Art of Hosting in Hualien in 2024 was a wonderful surprise for me—not only for its rich and playful methods, but also for the deeper practice of how to hold space for ourselves and for one another to engage in authentic dialogue. Since then, I’ve been bringing AoH into my collaborative and educational work, discovering it as a kind of magical treasure box—filled not only with methods and practices, but also with people who deeply believe in dialogue and process.

After well over a decade of professional career as a cross-border M&amp;A lawyer, I realised that nature and human connection are my true calling, so I spent 3 years travelling overland through the developing world as a nomadic storyteller, documenting disappearing heritage and livelihoods. This journey later led me to co-found “theNOMLab” in Shanghai, an artisanal food brand reviving heirloom recipes and honouring slow, intentional craftsmanship.</p>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">I first experienced AoH in the summer of 2024, when serendipity led me to a training in Karlskrona, Sweden. I was deeply touched and inspired by the AoH approach, and started integrating its principles into my life and work — by trusting emergence, embracing collective wisdom and everyone’s unique magic, and learning to hold space with a passive yet conscious awareness. This later led me to co-organise the first AoH training in mainland China in late 2024, held in Shanghai. The heart-led philosophy also informed my exploration in holistic wellness coaching, where I blend somatic practices, mindful inquiry, and the trust in unfolding discovered on the road, to empower people to tap into their self-healing powers, and reacquaint themselves to mother nature. Throughout this journey, I try to remain humble and true to my heart, and grateful for everything that brought me to this moment.</p>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">By calling for this first AoH training in Hong Kong, my home, I am hoping to bring to this place a safe and heartfelt space for authentic dialogue, whether with oneself, or with one another.

I served as a magazine editor-in-chief for ten years before shifting my focus to innovative community work five years ago. Together with friends, I co-founded the alternative education platform \"Unfolding,\" exploring the interplay between collective and personal transformation.</p>\n<p>Facing a world in upheaval and fractured organisations, I have embarked on an inner journey in recent years. At this stage of life, rediscovering myself has led to a profound realization: reconciling with oneself is the key to walking together with others. The path to reconciliation—peace—is never solely a matter of personal cultivation; it is the fruit of mutual support between people. Communities bound by genuine connection spark greater creativity and resilience.</p>\n<p>Yet, how difficult true connection can be! For years, I have sought ways to foster it. In 2024, an opportunity led me to Hualien to participate in \"Art of Hosting,\" an utterly transformative experience. I went expecting to learn facilitation techniques, but instead encountered a community of mentors whose values and worldview were profoundly different. Their approach to organization, event design, and fundamental beliefs about people and community stood in stark contrast to the prevailing Hong Kong ethos—characterized by a drive for quick results and a constant need to project professionalism. These mentors embodied humility, practised deep listening, trusted the power of space, and were steadfast companions who believed in the innate capacity for life to connect itself.</p>\n<p>This year, under the banner of \"Unfolding,\" I am bringing \"Art of Hosting\" to Hong Kong. I do so with trepidation, fearing that the pace here is too rushed, too hurried, for people to truly immerse themselves. Yet, this is my home after all, and I yearn to introduce the best I have found.
