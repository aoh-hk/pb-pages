The harvest can be found here.</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"align-left\">Calling Question</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>How can we reconnect to our shared humanity -- so that we  can weave a thriving future for all?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In these past years, our world has transformed at breakneck speed: social upheaval, a historic pandemic, waves of migration, economic instability, relentless climate shifts, and the seismic rise of AI. Suddenly, it can seem that the familiar has vanished, leaving the future shrouded in uncertainty. We feel that we are standing on fractured ground, gazing at a horizon we struggle to define. We may feel that we don’t even know ourselves anymore.</p>\n<p>Yet beneath the turbulence, an unshaken truth endures—a quiet, stubborn love for the places we call home. Though the path ahead remains uncharted, our roots hold firm, even when overshadowed by the noise of conflict.</p>\n<p>So we ask: Can we mend our fragmented world and co-create a future that honors our shared humanity, embraces complexity, and reclaims neglected interdependence? How do we stand in these broken places, listen across divides, and plant seeds of intention for a collective tomorrow?</p>\n<p>Perhaps now is the time to return to essentials — to truly listen and support each other and to find generative ways to work and co-create together.</p>\n<p>This is where The Art of Hosting and Harvesting Conversations That Matter becomes vital.</p>\n<p>Join us on our 4-day transformative journey designed to equip you with the tools to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Host dialogues that bridge divides</li>\n<li>Navigate diversity with curiosity</li>\n<li>Cultivate shared understanding</li>\n<li>Harness our collective wisdom to shape tomorrow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, we’ll learn, grow, and put these practices into action-building foundations for a future woven from courage, connection, and hope.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/74325910?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc&dnt=1\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h3 class=\"align-left\">A Global Community</h3>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Art of Hosting (AoH) has been developed and formed into a coherent whole over 20 years by a global community of practitioners dedicated to making the world a better place. It has been applied in a wide range of environments – from corporate and institutions in private and public sectors, to communities and families.</p>\n<p>Organisations using AoH as a working practice report better collaboration and decision-making, more innovation, greater ability to quickly respond to opportunity, challenge and change, and improved relationships. People who experience AoH typically say that they walk away feeling more inspired and empowered, and more able to guide the meetings and conversations they are part of to move towards desirable outcomes.</p>\n<p>If you would like to know more, please visit <a href=\"www.artofhosting.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.artofhosting.org</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"align-left\">What is Art of Hosting?</h3>\n<p>Art of Hosting (AoH) is a highly effective suite of powerful conversational processes and practices to harness the collective intelligence of groups, to foster effective multi-stakeholder collaboration and create robust, sustainable solutions. The name reflects that the heart of our practices are conversations that make a difference. The art is in holding them in a way that empowers people to step in and take accountability. It fosters dynamic open spaces where deep listening, connection, and growth flourishes.</p>\n<p>We will spend our time engaging in profound conversations about what matters to us, centered around our core calling question, where you will be able to practice deep listening, asking powerful questions, and using a suite of participatory techniques guided by an international team of experienced practitioners.</p>\n<p>AoH also places emphasis on 'harvesting' — the process of distilling insights and seeds of action from conversations, rather than simply recording results. Good harvesting leads to new understandings, actionable proposals, and deeper trust and connection, serving as the nourishment for ongoing transformation.</p>\n<p>The training is fully participatory — you will have the opportunity to immediately apply what you learn into practice, and to learn through practice. Rooted in AoH’s fundamental patterns, we will explore methods, frameworks and theories that support meaningful conversations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Circle Way</li>\n<li>World Café</li>\n<li>Open Space Technology</li>\n<li>Appreciative Enquiry</li>\n<li>Storytelling</li>\n<li>The Chaordic Path</li>\n<li>Designing for Wiser Action</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of all, it will be fun! You will bond with, exchange interesting stories and insights from people of different backgrounds and cultures, learn from each others’ experiences, and discover a sense of community that often continues well beyond the training itself. You will come away from the training feeling refreshed and empowered, and perhaps with a seed of change planted that you may not even realise!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The world we have made, as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far, creates problems we cannot solve at the same level of thinking at which we created them.” - Albert Einstein</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"align-left\">Who is this training for?</h3>\n<p>If you are a business or team leader, a facilitator or group process consultant, a community supporter or just someone interested in creating better meetings, this immersive and practical training is for you.</p>\n<p>It will be a fantastic opportunity to learn and connect with others who are exploring the power of collaboration, leading systemic change and innovation in China, Asia and worldwide.</p>\n<p><strong>Join us if you are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ready to step into the challenging conversations that can lead to innovation</li>\n<li>Wondering how to make inclusive decisions in an efficient way</li>\n<li>Eager to create a more horizontal work culture in your organisation</li>\n<li>Passionate to bring new life to a project or initiative through collaboration</li>\n<li>Already hosting networks or systemic change initiatives, and curious about how to deepen them, scale them up or make them more sustainable</li>\n<li>Inspired to make a positive impact on those around you</li>\n<li>Curious and open to explore new ways of being and doing</li>\n<li>Exploring dialogue-based facilitation as a life path and career choice</li>\n<li>Ready to turn a new life chapter, and seeking for inspiration and support from a diverse community of practitioners</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>We welcome you with open hearts!</em></p>\n<h3>What will you learn and experience?</h3>\n<div class=\"framer-1qroh3v\" data-framer-component-type=\"RichTextContainer\">\n<p class=\"framer-text\"><strong>By joining this training, you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn how to design, host and harvest an engaging event – meetings, workshops, conferences, lectures</li>\n<li>Gain new models that help make sense of complexity and improve decision making at work</li>\n<li>Learn how to design and use powerful questions to enable more reflection and innovation</li>\n<li>Experience a style of leadership that fosters psychological safety, opening up the possibility of making your personal and professional lives much more integrated and enjoyable</li>\n<li>Get an experience and basic understanding of powerful collaborative methodologies that can be put to practice in groups of any size</li>\n<li>Make new friends and connect to a thriving global network of practitioners</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/143626237?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc&dnt=1\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h3>Participation Fee &amp; Registration</h3>\n<p>To allow this training to be as inclusive as possible, while balancing the need to enable the training to happen and support a fair and healthy economy, we are offering a 3-tiered fee structure as follows.

Originally from the United States, I have been traveling the world since becoming an exchange student at the age of 17, following the red thread of story. I currently have a home base in Ohio, another heart home in New Zealand, and an impatient suitcase in the closet.</p>\n<p>Over the past 30 years, I have honed my craft as an internationally recognized process host, working with individuals, communities, and organizations to bring their stories to life. I am a steward of Art of Hosting, teaching participatory practices globally, a steward of the Flow Game (<a href=\"www.flowgame.net\">www.flowgame.net</a>) and co-creator of the Collective Story Harvest methodology. My work emphasises creating spaces where people can discover and live into the stories that lead to their most flourishing futures.</p>\n<h5 class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">Narayan Silva (Steward) </strong><span class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">🇧🇷</strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">I grew up in Brazil but I see myself as a global citizen, with a mixed blood and many years living in various countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas. I holds an MSc. in Strategic Leadership towards Sustainability, and am guided by my passion to support people and organizations who want to realize their potential for creating positive impact.</p>\n<p>I experienced my first Art of Hosting training in Sweden in 2013, which had a huge impact in my work. Since then I have dedicated my life to this field, which has allowed me to host collaborative processes for numerous organizations around the world and from all sectors. I have lived in Vietnam to co-lead Knowmads Hanoi before moving to Shanghai in 2018 to join the sustainability consulting agency Constellations as an associated partner. In China, I work mostly with European multinationals with ambitious sustainability goals, Sino-European governmental partnerships and public institutions.​</p>\n<h5 class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">Joanna Pyres </strong><span class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">🇮🇳 🇬🇧</strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">Half Indian and half English, I have been working in sustainable development collaboration for the past 23 years. Working as an Associate of Business in the Community, The Partnership Brokers Association, and The Partnering Initiative, I worked with governments, the EU, INGOs, and businesses around the world. Everywhere i went people and communities were absent from decision making about their future. This ignited a passionate quest for practices that support communities to participate in sustainable development so they can shape their own destinies.</p>\n<p>I co-founded Circlewallas to build local capacity for conscious collaboration, and ActforGoa, a collaborative platform for climate action and green progress in Goa, where I live with my family.</p>\n<h5 class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">Linh Phạm </strong><span class=\"framer-text\">🇻🇳</span></h5>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">I first encountered the Art of Hosting in 2016, when I helped organize the very first training in Vietnam. Since then, I’ve been an active participant in this field, bringing the practice into universities, companies, and organizations.</p>\n<p>I’m also a founding member of Đom Đóm Lab, a group of illuminators with the mission to experiment with and share the practices of self-organization.</p>\n<h3>Meet The Apprentices</h3>\n<h5 class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">Nguyen Doan Huân </strong><span class=\"framer-text\">🇻🇳</span></h5>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">I am a dialogue facilitator working across the supply chains of international brands to strengthen workplace dialogue. Over the past 12 years, I have facilitated numerous conversations with a single mission: To create courageous spaces where people can truly listen to one another and openly share their perspectives on difficult topics.</p>\n<p>I strongly believe that collaboration is the key to addressing workplace challenges and improving human rights in supply chains. My work focuses on bringing diverse stakeholders together, building connections, and fostering dialogue on tough issues.</p>\n<p>In addition to facilitation, I am an expert in experiential learning. I design environments where people can learn through experience and reflection—an approach that mirrors my own passion for exploring life and connecting with others.</p>\n<h5 class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">Gladys Tang </strong><span class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">🇭🇰</strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">Raised in Hong Kong, I've embraced a rich cultural landscape that bridges East and West. Having worked in different international companies on areas of social responsibility and sustainability has emphasized the profound importance of human connection. After 20 years working in corporate, I have decided to change my career to become a dialogue facilitator -- a path driven by a passion for meaningful conversations that spark transformative change.</p>\n<p>Besides being a facilitator, I am drawn to visual harvesting as it complements with deep listening in practice for developing healthy connections.</p>\n<p>After my first participation of Art of Hosting in Vietnam in March 2024, I have admired the principles behind the 4-Fold Practice. Likewise, the authenticity, positive energy, and the togetherness that were exuded during the training have touched my heart. This has led me to continue my journey with Art of Hosting since and participate in further AoH trainings. Some questions remain in my mind and these will be carried as I play the role of apprentice this time in Art of Hosting Hong Kong: How can I bring the energy and meaning from the AoH community to people outside? How can I keep my practice of the 4-Fold when I return?</p>\n<h3>Meet The Organising Team</h3>\n<h5 class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">Brent Que </strong><span class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">🇵🇭</strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">As a shape-shifting learning facilitator and process artist, I navigate complex landscapes of communication and systemic understanding. My work embraces the delicate art of creating spaces where latent insights emerge and unspoken truths find voice.</p>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">Drawing from my experience at the Art of Hosting in Shanghai during November 2024, I have deepened my commitment to designing careful, intentional environments. These spaces invite individuals and groups to see clearly what is unseen, listen deeply what is unspoken, and respond wisely what is inconceivable. All are afforded in earnest.</p>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">Through a trans-disciplinary approach, I seek to cultivate pragmatic ways of being attuned to the world we belong to -- recognising the subtle laws of nature and the intricate web of connections that bind everything together. My practice is a continuous exploration of how we can relate, listen, and act with equanimity and compassion, honouring the profound intelligence that exists beyond our human capacities.</p>\n<h5 class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">Carmen Lee </strong><span class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">🇭🇰</strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">I am a nonprofit practitioner working between Hong Kong and Taiwan. I enjoy collaborating with different teams, using participatory approaches to reflect, connect, and learn together. My work often engages with global citizenship education, drama education, and participatory evaluation. I love being a collaborator—exploring through dialogue how communities and societies can become more caring, just, and sustainable.</p>\n<p>After twenty years in this field, I’ve come to realise that meaningful change begins with learning how to connect with ourselves before we can truly connect with others and with our communities. This is never easy. In the busy nonprofit world, we often strive for change but sometimes push in the wrong way. Attending the Art of Hosting in Hualien in 2024 was a wonderful surprise for me—not only for its rich and playful methods, but also for the deeper practice of how to hold space for ourselves and for one another to engage in authentic dialogue. Since then, I’ve been bringing AoH into my collaborative and educational work, discovering it as a kind of magical treasure box—filled not only with methods and practices, but also with people who deeply believe in dialogue and process. I feel honored to be part of the Organizing Team for the first AoH gathering in Hong Kong, and I look forward to sharing this learning journey with all of you.</p>\n<h5 class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">Fiona Wan </strong><span class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">🇭🇰</strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">I have spent most of my life building bridges – from resolving conflicts between transaction stakeholders, to narrowing language barriers and cultural differences. After well over a decade of professional career as a cross-border M&amp;A lawyer, I realised that nature and human connection are my true calling, so I spent 3 years travelling overland through the developing world as a nomadic storyteller, documenting disappearing heritage and livelihoods. This journey later led me to co-found “theNOMLab” in Shanghai, an artisanal food brand reviving heirloom recipes and honouring slow, intentional craftsmanship.</p>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">I first experienced AoH in the summer of 2024, when serendipity led me to a training in Karlskrona, Sweden. I was deeply touched and inspired by the AoH approach, and started integrating its principles into my life and work — by trusting emergence, embracing collective wisdom and everyone’s unique magic, and learning to hold space with a passive yet conscious awareness. This later led me to co-organise the first AoH training in mainland China in late 2024, held in Shanghai. The heart-led philosophy also informed my exploration in holistic wellness coaching, where I blend somatic practices, mindful inquiry, and the trust in unfolding discovered on the road, to empower people to tap into their self-healing powers, and reacquaint themselves to mother nature. Throughout this journey, I try to remain humble and true to my heart, and grateful for everything that brought me to this moment.</p>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">By calling for this first AoH training in Hong Kong, my home, I am hoping to bring to this place a safe and heartfelt space for authentic dialogue, whether with oneself, or with one another. I believe true change and powerful solutions could only emerge when we listen deeper than our differences.</p>\n<h5 class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">Sandy Lee </strong><span class=\"framer-text\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">🇭🇰</strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">I am a writer, a facilitator, a ceramic artist, and an apprentice to nature. I served as a magazine editor-in-chief for ten years before shifting my focus to innovative community work five years ago. Together with friends, I co-founded the alternative education platform \"Unfolding,\" exploring the interplay between collective and personal transformation.</p>\n<p>Facing a world in upheaval and fractured organisations, I have embarked on an inner journey in recent years. At this stage of life, rediscovering myself has led to a profound realization: reconciling with oneself is the key to walking together with others. The path to reconciliation—peace—is never solely a matter of personal cultivation; it is the fruit of mutual support between people. Communities bound by genuine connection spark greater creativity and resilience.</p>\n<p>Yet, how difficult true connection can be! For years, I have sought ways to foster it. In 2024, an opportunity led me to Hualien to participate in \"Art of Hosting,\" an utterly transformative experience. I went expecting to learn facilitation techniques, but instead encountered a community of mentors whose values and worldview were profoundly different. Their approach to organization, event design, and fundamental beliefs about people and community stood in stark contrast to the prevailing Hong Kong ethos—characterized by a drive for quick results and a constant need to project professionalism. These mentors embodied humility, practised deep listening, trusted the power of space, and were steadfast companions who believed in the innate capacity for life to connect itself.</p>\n<p>This year, under the banner of \"Unfolding,\" I am bringing \"Art of Hosting\" to Hong Kong. I do so with trepidation, fearing that the pace here is too rushed, too hurried, for people to truly immerse themselves. Yet, this is my home after all, and I yearn to introduce the best I have found. Looking forward to meeting you.</p>\n<h5><strong class=\"framer-text\">Unfolding</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"framer-text\">Founded in 2022, Unfolding is an alternative education platform created by a group of practitioners of Nonviolent Communication (NVC) and artists.
